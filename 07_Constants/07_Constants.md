# Constant

Constants are variables whose value cannot be changed once assigned.If you declare a constant variable then there is no way its value changes.The keyword for using constants is **const** .Following is the syntax to create a constant.

```rust
    const VARIABLE_NAME:dataType=value;
```

Rustâ€™s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words.Note that there is no **let** keyword used. Following shows an example.

```rust
 fn main() {

 const USER_LIMIT:i32=100;
 const PI:f32 = 3.14;

 println!("user limit is {}",USER_LIMIT);
 println!("pi value is {}",PI);

}
```

## Constants vs Variables

- Constants are declared using **const** keyword and variables using **let**

- Data type of variable is at time of declaration is optional but for constants the type must be annotated.This means `const USER_LIMIT=100` will give error.

- A variable  declared using **let** keyword is by default immutable. But you have an option to make it mutable using **mut** keyword.

- Constants may be set only to a constant expression, not to the result of a function call or any other value that could only be computed at runtime

- Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which makes them useful for values that many parts of the code need to know about.

## Shadowing

 Rust allows programmers to declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable, and the new variable shadows the previous variable.
 Let us understand this with an example.

 ```rust
fn main() {
let salary = 100.00;
let salary = 1.50 * salary; // 50 % hike
println!("salary after hike is :{}",salary);

 let name="Mohtashim";
 let name= name.len();
 println!("name changed to integer : {}",name);
}
```

From the above example lets take varialbe salary , its value is 100.00 floating value . Its is then multiplied and assigned to another variable of same name. This is allowed in Rust. Since salary is immutable or readonly you can only read the contents of the variable. Second variable which shadows or hides the first variable while printing.

output is : `salary after hike is :150`

Let us take another example where a string variable is used with name assigned . Now we are shadowing the string variable to an integer type. Changing the type while shadowing is allowed in Rust as shown below.

```rust
fn main() {

 let name="Mohtashim";
 let name= name.len();
 println!("name changed to integer : {}",name);
}
```

output is `name changed to integer : 9`
