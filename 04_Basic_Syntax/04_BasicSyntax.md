# HelloWorld Example

This chapter explains the basic syntax of Rust lang through a **HelloWorld** example.

- Create a **HelloWorld-App** folder and navigate to that folder on terminal

```javascript
C:\Users\Admin>mkdir HelloWorld-App
C:\Users\Admin>cd HelloWorld-App
C:\Users\Admin\HelloWorld-App>

```

- To create a Rust file execute the following command:

```javascript

C:\Users\Admin\HelloWorld-App>notepad Hello.rs

```
Rust program files have an extension *.rs*.
The above command will create an empty file **Hello.rs** and opens it in notepad . Add the code given below to this file-

```rust
fn main(){
 println!("Rust says Hello to TutorialsPoint !!");
}

```
//appu: what is fn keyword/ main() and println()

- Compile the **Hello.rs** file using **rustc**.

```javascript
C:\Users\Admin\HelloWorld-App>rustc Hello.rs

```

Once the compilation is successful it will generate an executable file. You can verify if the .exe file is generated by executing the following command.

```javascript
C:\Users\Admin\HelloWorld-App>dir
//lists the files in folder
Hello.exe
Hello.pdb
Hello.rs
```

-Execute the Hello.exe file and verify the output

```javascript
C:\Users\Admin\HelloWorld-App>Hello.exe

Rust says Hello to TutorialsPoint !!

```

## Using Coding Ground

 Open the REPL shell [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_rust_online.php) .Write code in the shell and execute the program as shown below.

//appu : put this in the first eg
//appu: println syntax
## Syntax Understanding

` println!("Rust says Hello to TutorialsPoint !!");`

- println is the name of a macro defined in the Rust standard library.

- ! A macro is defined by appending an *!* to the function name. 

//appu : add as a note Without such a symbol, print would instead indicate a function. There is no such function in the Rust standard library, and so you would get a compilation error. A macro is a thing similar to a function - itâ€™s some Rust code to which a name is associated. By using this name, you ask to insert such code in this point.
//appu : what is a macro

- You can print multiple strings using a single *println* statement.
`println!("{}, {}", "Rust says Hello to ", "TutorialsPoint");`

//appu : todo simplify this
In this case, the print macro receives three arguments, separated by commas. All three arguments are literal strings. The first argument, contains two pairs of braces ({}). They are placeholders, indicating the positions in which the otherfollowing strings shouldto insert the other two strings.

## Comments

The following code given will output 34

```rust
// This program
// prints a number.
print!("{}", 34); // thirty-four
/* print!("{}", 20);
*/

```

Single line comments are indicated using `//` and multiline comments using `/* */`

## Debug Print

As we saw, the "print" and "println" macros accept only a string as their first argument, but the possible further arguments can be of various types, including integer numbers, floating-point numbers, and Boolean values. However, if you want to print the contents of an array or of a vector, the following code is not allowed:
print!("{} {}", [1, 2, 3], vec![4, 5]);
because both the array passed as second argument, and the vector passed as third argument have no standard display format, and so two error messages are emitted.
Though, when debugging a program, it is useful to display the contents of such structures, without having to resort to "for" loops. For this purpose, you can write
print!("{:?} {:?}", [1, 2, 3], vec![4, 5]);
that will print "[1, 2, 3] [4, 5]".
By inserting the characters :? enclosed in the braces of a placeholder, you are telling the print macro (and the println macro) to generate a debug format for the corresponding data. So, whenever you want to print the contents of any variable, even if "{}" does not work, you may hope that "{:?}" works.
