# Smart Pointers

Rust allocates everything on the stack by default. To store things on the heap you have to do so explicitly ,usually by wrapping them in smart pointers like `Box`.Types like Vec and String implicitly does heap allocation..The characteristic that distinguishes a smart pointer from an ordinary struct is that smart pointers implement following traits


|Sr.No|trait name|package|description
|:---|:---|:---|:-------|
|1|Deref|std::ops::Deref|Used for immutable dereferencing operations, like *v.
|2|Drop|std::ops::Drop|Used to run some code when a value goes out of scope. This is sometimes called a *destructor*

This chapter discusses on  **Box** smart pointer and how to create a custom smart pointer like Box.

## Box<T>

The most straight forward smart pointer is a box, whose type is written as Box<T>. A Box allows you to store data on the heap rather than the stack. The stack contains the pointer to the heap data.A Box doesnâ€™t have performance overhead, other than storing their data on the heap.

Let us see how to use a box to store an i32 value on the heap.

```rust

    fn main() {
        let var_i32 = 5; //stack
        let b = Box::new(var_i32); //heap
        println!("b = {}", b);
    }

```

Output:

```rust

b = 5

```

In order to access a value pointed by a variable,use deferencing.The `*` is used as a dereference operator.Let us see how to use dereference with Box.

The following example shows a value type `x` is boxed to an object type.

```rust
 fn main() {
    let x = 5; //value type variable
    let y = Box::new(x); //y points to a new value 5 in the heap

    println!("{}",5==x);  
    println!("{}",5==*y); //dereferencing y
    }

```
The variable x is a value-type with the value 5. So, the expression `5==x` will return true. Variable `y` points to the heap and to access the value in heap we need to dereference using `*y`. ``*y` returns value 5. So, the expression `5==*y` returns true.

Output:

```rust
true
true

```

### Illustraion : Deref Trait

 The Deref trait, provided by the standard library, requires us to implement one method named *deref* that borrows *self* and returns a reference to the inner data

```rust
use std::ops::Deref;

struct MyBox<T>(T);

impl<T> MyBox<T> { // Generic structure with static method new
    fn new(x:T)->MyBox<T>{
        MyBox(x)
    }
}

impl<T> Deref for MyBox<T> {
  type Target = T;

    fn deref(&self) -> &T {
      &self.0  //returns data
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = MyBox::new(x); // calling static method

    println!("5==x is {}",5==x);
    println!("5==*y is {}",5==*y); // dereferencing y
     println!("x==*y is {}",x==*y);//dereferencing y
}


```

In the above example we creating a structure `MyBox` which is generic type.It implements the trait `Deref`,because of this trait we can access heap values wrapped by `y` using `*y`.

output is shown below

```rust
5==x is true
5==*y is true
x==*y is true
```

### Illustraion : Drop Trait

The Drop trait has `drop` method . This method will be called when a structure which implemented this trait goes out of scope .In some languages, the programmer must call code to free memory or resources every time they finish using an instance of a smart pointer. In Rust, you can achieve automatic memory de allocation using Drop trait.

```rust

use std::ops::Deref;

struct MyBox<T>(T);

impl<T> MyBox<T> {
    fn new(x:T)->MyBox<T>{
        MyBox(x)
    }
}

impl<T> Deref for MyBox<T> {
  type Target = T;

    fn deref(&self) -> &T {
      &self.0
    }
}


impl<T> Drop for MyBox<T>{
   fn drop(&mut self){
    
       println!("dropping MyBox object from memory ");
   }    
}

fn main() {
    let x = 50;
    MyBox::new(x);
    MyBox::new("Hello");
}
```

In the above example the drop method will be called twice as we are creating two objects in the heap.

output:

```rust
dropping MyBox object from memory
dropping MyBox object from memory 
```
